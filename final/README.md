About project and file organization
This zipped folder contains an assets folder containing the 'images' and 'stylesheets,' folder the latter of which contains the CSS file used in the site. There is also a 'javascript' folder featuring the scripts used to run the Google Maps API, Nodemailer and the theme/language toggles used in the site.

How to run
The site should be able to run locally on your device beginning from any .html file in the directory. Simply copy the path of each file and paste in your preferred browser. Files should also be compatible being run on VSCode's 'Live Server' extension for those using that IDE.
